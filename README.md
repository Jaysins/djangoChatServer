## Features

- **Create Chatroom:** Users can create new chatrooms.
- **List Chatroom:** View a list of available chatrooms.
- **Leave/Enter Chatroom:** Join or exit chatrooms.
- **Send Messages:** Send text messages and attachments (without size limits).
- **List Messages:** View messages in a chatroom.
- **WebSocket Support:** Real-time communication using WebSocket for users in chatrooms.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Django
- Django Channels (for WebSocket support)
- PostgreSQL (or your preferred RDBMS)
- Other necessary libraries and tools

## Project Structure

The project follows a folder structure for better organization and separation of concerns:

- **controller:** Handles API request and response logic.
- **service:** Contains business logic for the application.
- **repository:** Manages database interactions (SQL/query operations only).
- **entity:** Defines database models and entity relationships.

## Setup Instructions

To run the application locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Python and Django if not already installed.
3. Set up a virtual environment and activate it.
4. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Configure the database settings in `settings.py`.
6. Apply migrations with `python manage.py migrate`.
7. Start the server with `python manage.py runserver`.
8. Start the ASGI server with `daphne -p 8100 djangoChatServer.asgi:application`.


## API Endpoints

- **Create Chatroom:** `POST /api/chatroom/create`
- **List Chatroom:** `GET /api/chatroom/list`
- **Leave Chatroom:** `POST /api/chatroom/leave`
- **Enter Chatroom:** `POST /api/chatroom/enter`
- **Send Message:** `POST /api/chatroom/send-message`
- **List Messages:** `GET /api/chatroom/messages`

Detailed documentation about request and response formats for each endpoint is available in the respective controller files.

## WebSocket Integration

The chat feature utilizes WebSocket technology. Each user connected to a chatroom establishes a WebSocket connection to enable real-time messaging.

## Testing

Unit tests and integration tests are available in the `tests/` directory. Run tests using `python manage.py test`.
